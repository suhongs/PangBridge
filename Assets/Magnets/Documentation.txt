How the magnet attract a metallic object??

To simulate the magnetism, the magnet should attract objects that are close, so with a sphere collider around the magnet it detects the objects that have "Attractable" tag

and apply force to them. The force is applied in direction to the magnet, also you can change the power of the magnet, if it is normal or is a powerful magnet


HOW TO ADD A MAGNET TO THE GAME???

1- Take your magnet 3d model, add 2 colliders,  add the magnet script and configure the variables of speed and radius

2- For the attractable objects, add a collider, then duplicate it and check the "isTrigger" option, the objects must have "Attractable" tag

Also you have prefabs of magnets in the prefabs folder and a demo scene with all this package features
